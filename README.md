<h1> Radviz-using-D3.js </h1>

1. Static visualization, showing as anchors all data attributes. For the anchor name, used
the attribute's name. The last column is mapped to a color using a proper color scale.
All other columns are numeric. The last column is not used as an anchor!

2. Added interaction to your visualization.
    - Draggable anchors.
    - Slider for changing color opacity of all instances.

3. Smooth transition while dragging anchors (animation).

4. Added more information to nodes (tooltip).
5. Select which anchors to show.
